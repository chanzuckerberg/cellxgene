# cellxgene

### An experiment in interactive, performant exploration of single cell transcriptomics data.

<img align="right" width="350" height="218" src="./example-dataset/cellxgene-demo.gif" pad="50px">
cellxgene is an open-source exploration of how to bring powerful tools from modern web development to visualize and explore large single-cell transcriptomics datasets.
Started in the context of the [Human Cell Atlas Consortium](https://www.humancellatlas.org/), cellxgene hopes to both **enable scientists** to explore their data and to **equip developers** with scalable and reusable patterns and frameworks for visualizing large scientific datasets.

## Features

* **Visualization at scale:** built with [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to handle visualization of at least 1 million cells.

* **Interactive exploration:** select, cross-filter, and compare subsets of your data with performant indexing and data handling.

* **Flexible API:** the cellxgene client-server model is designed to support a range of existing analysis packages for backend computational tasks (eg scanpy), integrated with client-side visualization via a [REST API](https://restfulapi.net/).
