# AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This directory contains scripts to aid in creating and deploying cellxgene on
AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

This will result in a variant of cellxgene, running on AWS EC2 instances, serving data from S3.
All datasets must be in the CXG (tiledb) format (see `cellxene convert --help`),
and located under a single S3 prefix, which is accessible to the instance.
In the current incarnation, no access control is available
(outside of anything you configure yourself), so this is most appropriate for public datasets.

This is early development work, and will change significantly in the near future.
We would love feedback on it, but please assume it will change.

## Prerequisites

1. Some familiarity with AWS EB, S3, and IAM are needed.

2. Install the awsebcli.
   Instruction are here:
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html

3. In the top level directory, run `make build-client` to create the client static assets.

## Steps

These steps are meant to serve as an example.
There are many more options to these commands that may be important or necessary for your environment.

### 1. Make your matrix files available to the EB servers.

The following choices are known to work.

- S3 Bucket.
- POSIX filesystem (such as Lustre)
- Lustre filesystem backed by S3

S3 is convenient and the relatively inexpensive option.
Lustre is higher performance, but more expensive, and slightly more complex to setup and manage.
AWS supports a feature to back the Lustre filesystem with S3, which gives an easy to manage, high
performance option.

Once the storage is in place, the next step is to copy your data files to that location.
Currently cellxgene supports a flat file organization. Each matrix file is located under
the same s3 prefix or filesystem directory. This location is specified in the configuration
as the dataroot.

### 2. Create an elastic beanstalk application. For example:

```
EB_APP=cellxgene-app
eb init -p python-3.6 $EB_APP
```

### 3. Configuring cellxgene

All the cellxgene configuration options can be set from a configuration file.
A yaml config file containing all of the default configuration options can be generated like this:

`cellxgene launch --dump-default-config > myconfig.yaml`

The config file may then be customized before the app is deployed.

There are two ways to set the config file location, evaluated in this order:

First, if your config file is named "config.yaml" and exists in `customize/config.yaml`,
then it will be bundled with the application zip file and installed along
side the app on the EB servers.

Second, a potentially more flexible approach is to place your config file in a location accessible
to the EB servers, such as in S3. For example: s3://my-bucket/my-datasets/config.yaml.
Set the CXG_CONFIG_FILE environment variable to specify this location.

Another option is to set the CXG_DATAROOT environment variable. The dataroot
is the location where the matrix files are located.
This environment variable will override the dataroot in the config file (if specified).

### 4. Customization

The deployment can be customized in several ways, by adding files to a directory called
`customize` which is placed in this directory.

#### config file

This was described in the previous section.

#### static files

The cellxgene server can serve additional static webpages that will be associated with the app.
These include the about_legal_tos (terms of service), and about_legal_privacy, for example.
To use this feature, do the following:

- In this directory, create a sub directory called "customize/deploy/".
- Copy the files you want to serve into this directory
- modify your configuration file to set the location to these file: /static/cellxgene/deploy/<filename>

Example: you want to include an "about_legal_tos" and "about_legal_privacy" page to cellxgene.
Assume files called "tos.html" and "privacy.html" exist.

```
$ mkdir -p customize/deploy
$ cp <source_dir>/tos.html customize/deploy/tos.html
$ cp <source_dir>/privacy.html customize/deploy/privacy.html

# edit config.yaml
$ grep "/static/cellxgene/deploy" config.yaml
about_legal_tos: /static/cellxgene/deploy/tos.html
about_legal_privacy: /static/cellxgene/deploy/privacy.html
```

#### Inline javascript scripts

Additional scripts can be added using the server/inline_scripts config parameters.
To include these scripts in the deployment, use the following steps:

- In this directory, create a sub directory called "customize/inline_scripts".
- Copy the script files into this directory
- Modify your configuration file to set the location to these file (leaving off customize/inline_scripts)

For example, to add an inline script called "myscript.js":

```
$ mkdir -p customize/inline_scripts
$ cp <source_dir>/myscript.js customize/inline_scripts/myscript.js
# edit the config.yaml
$ grep inline_scripts config.yaml
  inline_scripts : [ myscript.js ]
```

#### Plugins

Optionally, you can add plugins to the server python code. To include a plugin in the deployment use the following steps:

```
$ mkdir -p customize/plugins
$ cp <source_dir>/<my_plugin>.py customize/plugins/<my_plugin>.py
```

#### ebextensions

Any additional config files intended for the `.ebextensions` directory of the artifact can be added
to the `customize/ebextensions` directory. Any file found here will be copied over.

#### requirements.txt

A custom requirements.txt can be supplied in customize/requirements.txt.
This file must fully specify the versions of all the python modules used by the server in the deployment.
This is useful to ensure that the dependencies do not change from one deployment to the next.
Therefore the custom/requirements.txt must all have exact versions specified (e.g. anndata==0.7.1).

This file can be generated the first time using a process like this:

```
#  assume you are running in this directory
$  virtualenv temp
$  source temp/bin/activate
$  pip install -r ../requirements.txt
$  mkdir -p customize
$  pip freeze > customize/requirements.txt
$  deactivate
$  rm -rf temp/
```

Keep the customize/requirememts.txt file, and reuse it for each deployment.
If a future cellxgene version updates its requirements by modifying a module version
or adding a new dependency, then the `make build` process will detect any
incompatibilities and raise an error.

#### File structure for customizations

The following diagram shows the file structure for the customization directory.

```
customization
+-- config.yaml
+-- deploy/  
+-- inline_scripts/
+-- plugins/
+-- ebextensions/ 
+-- requirements.txt
```

### 5. Create the artifact.zip file for the application

```
$ make build
```

### 6. Flask secret key

The application requires a secret key to be provided to flask, the web framework used by cellxgene.
There are three ways to provide the secret key:

- In the configuration file, update the server/flask_secret_key attribute.
- In the configuration file, update the external/aws_secrets_manager section to set the
  secret name and key that defines the flask secret key.
- An environment variable: `CXG_SECRET_KEY`

### 7. Create an environment

```
# name of the environment
$ EB_ENV=cellxgene-env

# type of ec2 instance to run the cellxgene server (for example)
$ EB_INSTANCE=m5.large

# One or both of the following environment variables needs to be set
$ CXG_DATAROOT=<location to your S3 bucket>
$ CXG_CONFIG_FILE=<location to your config file>

# Potentially also set an environment variable for the flask secret key,
# and other environemet variable described in the configuration file.

$ eb create $EB_ENV --instance-type $EB_INSTANCE \
   --envvars CXG_DATAROOT=$CXG_DATAROOT,CXG_CONFIG_FILE=$CXG_CONFIG_FILE
```

### 8. Give the elastic beanstalk environment access to the dataroot.

If using S3, this link may provide some useful information:
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/elastic-beanstalk-s3-bucket-instance/
If using Lustre, then this link may provide a place to start:
https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/

### 9. Deploy the application

```
$ eb deploy $EB_ENV
```

### 10. Open the application in a browser

```
$ eb open $EB_ENV
```

## Advanced Features

### Authentication

Authentication can be configured in the configuration file. Authentication is required
for User Annotations (see below). User Annotations is a feature where annotations can be
created by the user
, and
then associated with the user's id.
When the user revisits the site, their annotations will be available.

There are three main authentication modes: null, session, or oauth.  
In the configuration file specify the authentication mode by setting
`server / authentication / type`.

#### null

Authentication is disabled: user annotations cannot be enabled.

#### session

The user is associated with their client browser session. This approach is
simple to setup, but not recommended for hosted cellxgene, since the user will not have access to
their annotations when running from a different browser, or if their cookies get cleared.

#### oauth

A user logs into cellxgene using an identity provider (like Google), or logs in using
an email/password. This is the best option, but requires making use of an oauth service and
additional configuration of the cellxgene server.

To see what this looks like, please look at https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/,
and view one of the cellxgene datasets.
For this server, Auth0 (auth0.com) is used for authentication, but there are other options.
There are good sources of documentation online that describe how to use one of these
services.

The `params_oauth` section in the configuration file describes characteristics of the
authentication service, like "client_id" and "client_secret".  
For security, the client_secret needs to be protected. One option is to
store it in the AWS Secrets Manager.

### User Annotations

User annotations can be configured in the configuration file both generally and for a specific data route. The annotations feature is only available when Authorization is enabled. 
To enable Annotations, it is necessary to create a relational database and add the database uri (typically `postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname]`) to the secrets manager under `DB_URI`. 
The hosted version of cellxgene runs on AWS's [Aurora PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.AuroraPostgreSQL.html) but any sqlalchemy compatible relational database should work. 
Once the database is set up apply the cellxgene schema to your database by running the following inside the cellxgene repo
`PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`
`python3`
Inside the python console
`from sqlalchemy import create_engine`
`from server.db.cellxgene_orm import Base`
`uri = "[DB_URI]”`
`engine = create_engine(uri)`

 Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`

To check the schema was properly applied (or just to check what is in the database at any point)
ssh into your database. For a postgres database this entails running:  
`psql [DB_URI]`

You'll also need to update your IAM policies to allow the instance to write to the s3 bucket.
