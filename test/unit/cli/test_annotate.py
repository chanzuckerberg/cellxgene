        """
        Invokes the `annotate` subcommand of cellxgene CLI, using a CliRunner() programmatic invocation.

        This tests the happy path case:
        1) Command line options are parsed;
        2) An MLflow model zip archive can be read in (from local disk), unpacked, and invoked;
        3) The correct options are passed to the MLflow model.
        4) The annotate subcommand exits successfully.

        This does not verify model output or predictions (it's a fake MLflow model, after all); it's up to the real model
        to output its predictions as it wants, but this is specific to the model and so not tested here.

        The  CliRunner() invokes the subcommand in a subprocess, and the annotate subcommand itself invokes the MLflow
        model in yet another subprocess. So while this test can help determine if everything is working, it is not a
        simple matter to debug in the case of a failure. However, the stdout/stderr of the MLflow process is captured
        by the CliRunner() subprocess, so errors can be inspected in result.stdout when debugging this test. Hope this
        helps!
