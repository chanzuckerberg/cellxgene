    # By default, cellxgene will serve api requests from the same base url as the webpage.
    # In general api_base_url and web_base_url will not need to be set.
    # There are two reasons to set these parameters:
    #  1. Oauth authentication is used; the oauth server will redirect back to the api_base_url after login,
    #     which then redirects back to the web_base_url.  If the web_base_url is not set, it will default to
    #     the api_base_url.  If oauth authentication is used, the api_base_url must be set.
    #     For a local test (where the server runs on "http://localhost:<port>"), then the api_base_url may be
    #     set to the string "local".
    #  2. The cellxgene deploymnent is in an environment where the webpage and api have
    #     different base urls.  In this case both api_base_url and web_base_url must be set.
    #     It is up to the server admin to ensure that the networking is setup correctly for this environment.
    api_base_url: http://localhost:5005
    web_base_url: http://localhost:3000

  authentication:
    # The authentication types may be "none", "session", "oauth"
    # none:  No authentication support, features like user_annotations must not be enabled.
    # session:  A session based userid is automatically generated. (no params needed)
    # oauth: oauth2 is used for authentication;  parameters are defined in params_oauth.
