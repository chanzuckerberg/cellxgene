/*
State transition graph for complex action/history interactions.

Assumed configuration from undoableConfig:
    * By convention, "init" is used as the start state for all, and "done"
      as the final state.
    * Unexpected states will result in an error, plus a clear and cancelPending
      side-effect.

TODO: is is possible there is a more concise format for this, as it is
a fairly repetitive pattern.

These events are largely one of two types:
a) async operations or multi-event options that should only be committed
upon some success criteria, otherwise cancelled.

b) compound actions that should be collapsed into a single history change.
