  /*
  Abstract base class for all AnnoMatrix objects.  This class provides a proxy
  to the annotated matrix data authoritatively served by the server/back-end.

  AnnoMatrix instances are immutable, meaning that their schema and dimensionality
  will not change, and simple object equality can be used to detect structural
  changes. The actual data is cached, and not guaranteed to be present -- any
  request to access data must be resolved by a fetch() call, which is async, and
  may involve a server round-trip.

  Guarantees made by the immutabilty, ie, any of these can be detected by
  simple annoMatrix compare:
    * schema is the same, including all fields and columns
    * dimensionality is the same (nObs, nVar)
    * data mapping/transformation, such as clipping, are the same

  AnnoMatrixes also "stack" like filters, allowing for the construction of
  views which transform the data in some manner.

  The bootstrap class is AnnoMatrixLoader, which is the caching server proxy, and
  is bootstrapped with a API URL:
    new AnnoMatirx(url, schema) -> annoMatrix

  There are various "views", such as AnnoMatrixRowSubsetView, which provide
  the same interface but with a transformed view of the server data.  Utilities in
  viewCreators.js can be used to create these views:
      clip(annoMatrix, min, max) -> annoMatrix
      subset(annoMatrix, rowLabels) -> annoMatrix
  etc.

		Field must be one of the matrix fields: 'obs', 'var', 'X', 'emb'.  Value
		represents the underlying object upon which the query is occuring.

		Query is one of:
			* a string, representing a single column name from the field, eg,
				"n_genes"
			* an object, containing an "value" query (see below).
			* an array, containing one or more of the above.

		Columns may have more than one dimension, and all will be fetched
		and returned together.  This is most commonly seen in an embedding,
    which usually has two dimensions.

		A value query allows for fetching based upon the value in another 
		field/column, similar to a join.  Currently only supported on the var
		dimension, allowing query of X columns by var value (eg, gene name)

    The query filter	is a single value filter:
			{ "field name": [
				{name: "column name", values: [ list of values ]}
			]}
		One and only one value filter is allowed in a value query.

		Examples:

    1. Fetch the "n_genes" column the "obs":

			const df = await fetch("obs", "n_genes")
      console.log("Largest number of genes is: ", df.summarize().max);

    2. Fetch two separate columns from obs.  Returns a single dataframe containing
       the columns:

			const df = await fetch("obs", ["n_genes", "louvain"])
      console.log("Cell 0 has category: ", df.at(0, "louvain"));

    3. Fetch an entire X (expression counts) column that has a var annotation
       value "TYMP" in the var index.

			fetch("X", { 
				where: {field: "var", column: this.schema.annotations.var.index, value: "TYMP"}
			})

      In AnnData & Pandas DataFrame API, this is equivalent to:
        adata.X[:, adata.var.index.get_loc("SUMO3")]

		The value query is a recodification and subset of the server REST API 
		value filter JSON.  Range queries and multiple filters are not currently

  These callbacks implement a GC policy for the cache.  Background:

    * For the Loader (base) annomatrix, re-filling the cache is expensive as
      it requires an HTTP fetch.
    * user-defined / writable columns must not be GC'ed as they may be
      still pending a save/commit.
    * For views, cost is less and (roughly) proportional with nObs
    * obs, var and emb do not grow without bounds, and are needed constantly 
      for rendering.  
      a) There is no upside to GC'ing these in the base (loader)
      b) The undo/redo cache can hold a large number in views, which is worht GC'ing
    * X is often much larger than memory, and the UI allows add/del from
      this.  Most of the GC potential is here in both the base and views.

  Current policy:
    * if in active use ("hot") do not GC obs, var or emb.
    * never, ever GC writable obs columns
    * For base/loader set a numeric limit on maximum X column count
    * For views, apply a fixed limit to the number of columns cached in any field.
